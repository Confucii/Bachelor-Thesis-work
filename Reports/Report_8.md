### Practical
Focal loss and CCE without weights work consistently and produce similar results.

## Concerns
### Theoretical 
Scalar inputs subsection is concerning, I am unsure if information that I have found is suitable for it.
#
Is 1-2 page introduction in the beginning of the work considered fully original piece of information or has to have references to the statements I make?
### Practical
I am not sure if I understand weighted loss functions correctly.
# 
Practical part is moving slowly, however the predefence is held in the end of April(submission was extended for me till 25th of April), therefore I am going to spend most of the month(approx 150 hours) preparing and finishing at least 75% of the work.

## Not finished
### Theoretical 
NormMax (Could not find info in books, didn't do additional research yet)
#
Example architecture (How many architectures, how simple?)
#
BCE (Could not find info in books, did research Springer, IEEE and ArXiv without success)
### Practical
The experiments have not started, weighted loss functions are not implemented
