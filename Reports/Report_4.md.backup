## Questions

### What to do about bachelor thesis report on 21st of January?

## Task 4
### PyTorch housing
#### Result
![Image](../Images/PyTorch_Housing.png "PyTorch Housing")
#### Problem 
When loss reaches approximately 79 it starts to rise again.
Learning Rate = 1e-4. In-out features are [13 6]->[6 1]

### Numpy Iris
#### Result

#### Problem 
Results are inconsistent and vary from run to run, should it be that way?

### Numpy Wine
#### Result
Very poor result, sometimes instead of values it shows "nan"

#### Problem 
Somehow with wine dataset, some of the y_prim values are zeroes, the fix that I tried is following:

The reason I did this is because otherwise the code would not run in any meaningful way, as it would give a division by zero error.

### PyTorch Wine
#### Result

#### Problem 
The loss and accuracy do not change much, they fluctuate in the same range continuously.

### Main Findings
In this work I have started working with classification tasks and have been introduced to PyTorch. PyTorch is a fascinating tool to be honest, I was impressed with the inherent implementation of gradient and how much it simplifies the coding experience at this stage. The classification tasks are interesting, however I have encountered a problem which I cannot solve currently, even though I aspire to do it. It seems to me that I am missing something crucial but because of my
